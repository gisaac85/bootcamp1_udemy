Hi! Welcome to the Web Developer Bootcamp, the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market. Here's why:

This is the only online course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor.
94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.
The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000. This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.
Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to today's developer industry. No PHP or other dated technologies. This course does not cut any corners.
This is the only complete beginner full-stack developer course that covers NodeJS.
We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.
The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules. Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.
